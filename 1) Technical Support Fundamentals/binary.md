## Question 1

How many possible values can we have with the 8 bits in a byte?

* 144
* 8
* 127
* **256**

> Since there are 8 bits with two values each, the highest number of possible values is 2 to the power of 8, or 256. 

<br>

## Question 2

What is the highest decimal value a byte can represent?

* **255**
* Any number
* 256
* 1

> There are 256 values in a byte, from the decimal number 0 to 255, which is the highest value since the count starts at 0.

## Question 3

Why did UTF-8 replace the ASCII character-encoding standard?


* **UTF-8 can store a character in more than one byte.**
* ASCII can store a character in more than one byte. 
* ASCII can store emojis.
* UTF-8 only uses 128 values.

> UTF-8 replaced the ASCII character-encoding standard because it can store a character in more than a single byte.

## Question 4

What is 10101010 in decimal format? Please use this Binary Table to find the answer.


| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|-----|----|----|----|---|---|---|---|
|  1  |  0 |  1 | 0  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |



* 48
* **170**
* 200
